# SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL portfolio.  
This repository contains examples of SQL queries and database projects I have worked on. It includes scripts for creating tables, inserting data, and running queries to analyze and manipulate data.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my understanding of SQL and my ability to work with structured data in various scenarios.

Feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you have any questions or would like to connect.
